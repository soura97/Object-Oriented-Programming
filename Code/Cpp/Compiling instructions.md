The use of member functions have been kept to a bare minimum, restricted only to cases which require direct access to the private datamembers.

    Compiling: eg. $g++ -std=c++11 -o item.cpp
    Executing: eg. $./a.out

the item program requires C++11, because enum is not recognized as a class or namespace in earlier versions.
